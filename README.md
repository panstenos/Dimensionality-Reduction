# Dimensionality-Reduction
Exploring the trade-offs between various dimensionality reduction algorithms and demonstrating the significance of dimensionality reduction.

## <u>Overview</u>
The aim of this project is to reduce the dimensionality of an image dataset and investigate the effectiveness of the different dimensionality-reduction models. To accomplish this, various dimensionality reduction algorithms were trained on a labeled training dataset consisting of digit images. Model performance was evaluated by measuring the test accuracy of transformed images using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm as the classifier. Following evaluations for different number of components, the optimal algorithm was chosen, and the advantages and disadvantages of alternative algorithms were evaluated.

## <u>Context</u>


## <u>About the dataset</u>
The MNIST dataset (the dataset used) is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit it represents. MNIST stands for "Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology," referring to the original dataset created from a subset of NIST's Special Database 3 and Special Database 1.
The dataset is often employed to explore various techniques, such as dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, and different neural network architectures. Researchers use it to demonstrate and compare the effectiveness of different methodologies.
It's important to note that while MNIST has been a foundational dataset, more challenging datasets and tasks have emerged over time, encouraging the development of more sophisticated models and algorithms. However, MNIST remains a classic and valuable resource in the machine learning community. The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.
